            <h2>Twitch Plays Pokemon Data Analyzer</h2>
            <p>
              Created a bot to analyze data for the Twitch Plays Pokemon stream in Python. The analyzer reads in the chat data from the stream 
              and analyzes the data to determine which team, red or blue, is more likely to win the match soley based on other player bets. 
              The bot currently uses the amount of money bet on each team and the nubmer of players who bet on each team as metrics
              to determine the winner. Using these predictions, the bot was able to double its balance within a few hours of operating.

          <h2>Minesweeper</h2>
          <p>
            Recreated the classic game of Minesweeper in C++. Matching functionality included a flagging system, random mine generation, recursive
            tile clearing, and win/lose conditions. Additional functionality such as a debug mode and custom board inputs were also included. The visuals 
            were created using the SFML library.</p>

          <h2>You Owe Me</h2>
          <p>
             Served as the interface developer in a 3 person team for a C++ application that allows users to determine locally optimal ways to pay debts to a 
             group of individuals using a bin packing algorithm. The interface, including the ability to scroll through the output and input transactions, 
             was created using the SFML library. The backend of the application was written in C++.
