          Hi! My name is Jonathan and I am a Junior Computer Science major at
          the University of Florida. At heart, I am a math enthusiast and I love
          to solve problems with elegant solutions.

          <h3>Twitch Plays Pokemon Data Analyzer</h3>

          />
          <p>
            Created a bot to analyze data for the Twitch Plays Pokemon stream in Python. The analyzer reads in the chat data from the stream 
            and analyzes the data to determine which team, red or blue, is more likely to win the match soley based on other player bets. 
            The bot currently uses the amount of money bet on each team and the nubmer of players who bet on each team as metrics
            to determine the winner. Using these predictions, the bot was able to double its balance within a few hours of operating.

          <p>
            Recreated the classic game of Minesweeper in C++. Functionality included a flagging system, random mine generation, recursive
            tile clearing, and win/lose conditions. The visuals were created using the SFML library.

             Served as the interface developer for a C++ application that allows users to determine locally optimal ways to pay debts to a 
             group of individuals. The interface was created using the SFML library and the application was created using C++. A video of the
             application can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XexfyNL5V34" target="_blank">here</a>.
