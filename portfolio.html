            <h2>Twitch Plays Pokemon Data Analyzer</h2>
            <p>
              Developed a Python bot that analyzes data from the Twitch Plays Pokemon stream and predicts the outcome of matches based on player betting behavior. 
              The bot uses the amount of in stream points bet on each team and the number of players who bet on each team as metrics to determine which team, red or blue, 
              is more likely to win. The bot has been effective in using these predictions to significantly increase its balance in a short period of time.

          <h2>ProtestPlots</h2>
          <p>
            Served as the front end developer in a 4 person team for a web application that allows users to discover protests in Florida.
            Implemented the search bar on the home page and most of the CSS for the 3 webpages. The team participated in weekly scrum meetings 
            and used GitHub to manage the project. The repository used CircleCI to run static analysis on the code.

          <h2>You Owe Me</h2>
          <p>
            Served as the interface developer in a 3 person team for a C++ application that allows users to determine 
            locally optimal ways to pay debts to a group of individuals via a bin packing algorithm. 
            The interface, including the ability to scroll through a filtered output and input transactions, was created purely using the SFML library. 
            The backend of the application was written in C++ with a Python script for visualization of the data.

        <h2>Minesweeper</h2>
        <p>
          Recreated the classic game Minesweeper in C++, 
          featuring all of the essential gameplay mechanics such as flagging, random mine generation, recursive tile clearing, and win/lose conditions. 
          Additional features include a debug mode and the ability to input custom board configurations. 
          The visuals for the game were created using the SFML library, adding a polished and visually appealing aspect to the project.
